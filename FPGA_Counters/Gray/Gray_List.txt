This directory contains VHDL based Gray counter function(s).

A VHDL based FPGA counter, can be FPGA vendor specific and/or FPGA family specific and so may possibly not be usable depending upon the target FPGA.

The following is a list of the VHDL based Gray counter function files within this directory:

  • gray_counter.vhd - Any Vendor, General purpose Gray counter.
                              - Generates a Gray count that auto rolls over (aka repeats).
                              - Inferrable.
  • gray_counter_TSTR.vhd - Simple testbench for gray_counter.vhd design unit.
