This directory contains VHDL based FPGA peripherals that:
  • Are inferrable.
  • Have been found to be of repeated use across multiple designs.

A VHDL based FPGA peripheral, can be FPGA vendor specific and/or FPGA family specific and so may possibly not be usable depending upon the target FPGA.

Each FPGA Peripheral is in its own sub-directory. Further each FPGA Peripheral may utilize one or more FPGA primitives or FPGA packages.
The following is a list of the VHDL based FPGA Peripherals within this directory:

  • /Pre-scaler/ - Xilinx, LUT based shift register pre-scaler with dynamic shift output tap.
