This directory contains VHDL based FPGA primitives that are:
  • Inferrable.
  • Have been found to be of repeated use across multiple designs.

A FPGA primitive, can be FPGA vendor specific and/or FPGA family specific and so may possibly not be usable depending upon the target FPGA.

The following is a list of the FPGA Primitives within this directory:

  • SRLE.vhd - Xilinx, LUT based shift register with dynamic shift output tap.
  • SRLCE.vhd - Xilinx, LUT based shift register with dynamic shift output tap AND max-depth output tap (typically utilized for cascading).
